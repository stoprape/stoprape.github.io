				<h2>What I'm doing to help stop rape in India</h2>
				<p><br>
				In January 2015, I, <a href="http://andykamath.com">Andy Kamath</a>, published my first blog post, entitled <a href="https://medium.com/@andykamath/what-happened-india-5d7f6040866f"><i>What happened, India?</i></a> on Medium. It in essence criticized the way that Indian women are getting violated left and right, and nothing is truly being done about it, though multiple surveys show that rape is India's number one priority.
				<br><br>
				As said in the article, "And what is India doing to stop [rape in the country]? Nothing. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Instead, we're focusing on banning a movie that pokes holes in religions, banning a movie that talks about the assassination of one of our great Prime Ministers, banning Uber because one driver couldn't control his urges, banning websites like GitHub and Vimeo, thus discouraging entrepreneurs from helping our economy, etc."
				<br><br>
				I once heard a parable that went something along the lines of this -
				<br><br>
				An old man is walking along the beach when he witnesses a young boy throwing starfish that had washed up on the shore back into the ocean. He asks the boy why he is doing this, because it's obvious that the boy's actions would not make a big difference in the starfish population. The boy responds "these few starfish may not make a difference to the world, but it makes a world of a difference to these few starfish".
				<br><br>
				This simple story inspired me to take action. As a High School student, I may not be able to do much, but whatever I CAN do will make a huge difference to whomever is helped. I am starting a crowdfunding option for people to raise money to pay for psychiatrists and lawyers, which to most people are extremely expensive, and for the majority of rape victims in India, who live in utter poverty, these two things alone cost way too much for them to handle. If all my Facebook friends just donated $10, that would end up as $7,150. This in my opinion should be a worthwhile cause. 
				<br><br>
				Helping other people makes me happy. I have participated as the Youth Leader for <a href="http://prathamusa.org">Pratham USA</a> for the city of Charlotte, NC. I have also received the Presidential Gold Volunteer Award for two years in a row, and am a Life-ranked Boy Scout.
				<br><br>
				Not to brag, but I love seeing the joy on someone's face when I help them out with something. As a sophomore in High School, I may not be able to do as much as someone with much more authority, but I can definitely do my part. <u><i><b>And so can you.</b></i></u>
				<br><br>
				<b>The next victim could be you, your sister, or your mother. Stop this now.</b></p>
